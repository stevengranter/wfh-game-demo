        <h3>Working Title</h3>
        <p>Wieners from Heaven: Maple Syrup Edition</p>
        <h3>Concept Statement</h3>
        <p>
          This game is a side-scrolling platforming game. It is a 16-bit
          SNES-style demaster of the full version of the "Wieners from Heaven"
          3D video game (TBA). The purpose of this project is to evaluate scope
          required to create the full-length game and to gauge interest from the
          gaming community by submitting to an itch.io game jam.
        </p>

        <h3>Player Experience</h3>
        <p>
          The player plays the role of "Nan", a 76-year-old grandmother. The
          main gameplay consists of navigating the character through
          side-scrolling outdoor scenes while attempting to catch wieners that
          are falling from the sky. Points are awarded for every collectible,
          with the opportunity for bonus points if certain tasks are completed
          successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nan has limited stamina, and can only jump a limited number of times
          before she has to wait for stamina to recharge. This adds a strategic
          challenge to level completion. She is able to consume wieners to
          recharge stamina more rapidly, but this reduces her hit point count
          and her cumulative point score for the level.
        </p>

        <h3>Visual and Audio Style</h3>
        <p>
          The game world is a bright cartoonish side-scrolling adventure in a
          16-bit pixel-art style. There are five levels, corresponding to the
          five regions of Canada (Atlantic, Central, The Prairies, West Coast,
          Northern Territories). Each level/region will feature landscape and
          architectural features unique to that region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Audio will be inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit era home console sound
          effects and music.
        </p>
        <h3>Game World Fiction</h3>
        <p>
          The player starts the game as an elderly grandmother, referred to as
          Nan. Her grandchildren are coming to visit but she doesn't have any
          food that they will eat. Without time to get to the grocery store, she
          prays for some kind of miracle. Suddenly wieners begin falling from
          the sky so she hurries outside to gather as many as she can. She gets
          a little carried away, and before she knows it, she's somehow managed
          to walk across Canada.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h3>Core Loops</h3>
        <p>
          The core game loop is the player navigating a side-scrolling 2D scene,
          attempting to collect wieners while avoiding hazards. There is an
          increase in difficulty with level progression.
        </p>

        <h3>Objectives and Progression</h3>
        <p>
          The game starts with a tutorial level in Nan's backyard to learn basic
          controls. It then leads into Level 1: Atlantic where Nan walks along
          the roadside catching wieners as they fall. The game ends with Nan
          making it through the Northern Territories (Level 5, most challenging)
        </p>

        <h3>Game System</h3>
        <p>
          Internal systems to be created include collision detection, sprite
          animation, parallax scrolling, state machines, object spawning,
          score-keeping and other game-related functions and/or classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          External systems accessed are a weather API (TBD) and leaderboard
          (potentially). The weather API call fetches latest Probability of
          Precipitation values for each of the five areas (Atlantic, Central,
          The Prairies,West Coast, Northern Territories). This value is used to
          calculate the POW (Probability of Wieners) value for each level.
          Players are encouraged to play on days when the weather across Canada
          is rainy to increase chances of collecting wieners and increasing
          their score.
        </p>

        <h3>Interactivity</h3>

        <p>
          Before gameplay during game selection, player is presented with a map
          of Canada showing POW 'forecast' values for the different regions.
          Player can then decide to play an individual level or as a progression
          through the levels in order.

        <p>
          Controls are touchscreen and mobile compatible, but offer more
          accuracy and enjoyment with keyboard or controller. During gameplay
          the player has to try to catch the collectibles, avoiding obstacles
          and threats, while considering the player's stamina and health. Quick
          decisions must be made about sacrificing collected points for stamina
          and/or health.
