### Overview 🌤️

This game is a side-scrolling platforming game in a 16-bit pixel-art style. The purpose of this project is to evaluate scope required to create a full-length game and to gauge interest from the gaming community by submitting to an itch.io game jam.

> ⛔️ **WARNING**: This game is incomplete, in active development (Feb-Mar 2024), and contains many, MANY bugs and broken or missing functionality/features. _It will probably be the opposite of fun and it may even crash your web browser._ 😳
