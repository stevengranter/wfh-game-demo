### Player Experience

The player plays the role of "Nan", a 76-year-old grandmother. The main gameplay consists of navigating the character through side-scrolling outdoor scenes while attempting to catch wieners that are falling from the sky. Points are awarded for every collectible, with the opportunity for bonus points if certain tasks are completed successfully.

Nan has limited stamina, and can only jump a limited number of times before she has to wait for stamina to recharge. This adds a strategic challenge to level completion. She is able to consume wieners to recharge stamina more rapidly, but this reduces her hit point count and her cumulative point score for the level.

### Visual and Audio Style

The game world is a bright cartoonish side-scrolling adventure in a 16-bit pixel-art style. There are five levels, corresponding to the five regions of Canada (Atlantic, Central, The Prairies, West Coast, Northern Territories). Each level/region will feature landscape and architectural features unique to that region.

Audio will be inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit era home console sound effects and music.

### Game World Fiction

The player starts the game as an elderly grandmother, referred to as Nan. Her grandchildren are coming to visit but she doesn't have any food that they will eat. Without time to get to the grocery store, she prays for some kind of miracle. Suddenly wieners begin falling from the sky so she hurries outside to gather as many as she can. She gets a little carried away, and before she knows it, she's somehow managed to walk across Canada.

## üïπÔ∏è Game System Design

### Core Loops

The core game loop is the player navigating a side-scrolling 2D scene, attempting to collect wieners while avoiding hazards. There is an increase in difficulty with level progression.

### Objectives and Progression

The game starts with a tutorial level in Nan's backyard to learn basic controls. It then leads into Level 1: Atlantic where Nan walks along the roadside catching wieners as they fall. The game ends with Nan making it through the Northern Territories (Level 5, most challenging)

### Game System

Internal systems to be created include collision detection, sprite animation, parallax scrolling, state machines, object spawning, score-keeping and other game-related functions and/or classes.

External systems accessed are a weather API (TBD) and leaderboard (potentially). The weather API call fetches latest Probability of Precipitation values for each of the five areas (Atlantic, Central, The Prairies,West Coast, Northern Territories). This value is used to calculate the POW (Probability of Wieners) value for each level. Players are encouraged to play on days when the weather across Canada is rainy to increase chances of collecting wieners and increasing their score.

### Interactivity

Before gameplay during game selection, player is presented with a map of Canada showing POW 'forecast' values for the different regions. Player can then decide to play an individual level or as a progression through the levels in order.

Controls are touchscreen and mobile compatible, but offer more accuracy and enjoyment with keyboard or controller. During gameplay the player has to try to catch the collectibles, avoiding obstacles and threats, while considering the player's stamina and health. Quick decisions must be made about sacrificing collected points for stamina and/or health.
